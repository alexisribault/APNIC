# APNIC

## Tasks:
1. Create/Use a Dockerised version of WordPress
2. Write code to consume this list: https://academy.apnic.net/wp-json/academy/virtual-labs
3. Display the list in point 2 on a WordPress page that uses a Frontend framework of your choice (React, Vue.js, Angular etc..) with the following functionality
Front end pagination
Drag and drop sorting
4. Put the code on Github under your account so that we can clone it, run it and see the page created in point 3. Please ensure you have a README.md that explains how to run your application.

## Clone Project

## React Development (only if the code need to be updated)

~~~
watch index.js file and build the react files to a build folder that wordpress reads

## Improvements: 
- add .env variables
- be more selective on what to push on github
- separate repository for the theme
